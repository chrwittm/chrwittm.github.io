    "## Creating a Local Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you're done developing your FastAPI app in a Jupyter Notebook, you can prepare it for local deployment by following these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating `app.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "To create the `app.py` file, follow these steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- Copy all the code from the final cell in the Jupyter Notebook and paste it into a new Python file named `app.py`.\n",
    "- Remove notebook-specific dependencies. Anything related to `nest_asyncio` is no longer needed, it is only necessary in Jupyter notebooks. Additionally, remove the `uvicorn.run(...)` call, as the server will be launched outside `app.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating `requirements.txt`\n",
    "\n",
    "For out simple project, you could easily create the `requirements.txt` file manually, but I am too lazy for that, so I am using the `pipreqs` package to generate it for me\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't have the `pipreqs` package installed, you can simply install it using pip:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install pipreqs\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can generate the `requirements.txt`. Either `cd` into the directory where your `app.py` file is located and run\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pipreqs .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can specify the path to the `app.py` file\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pipreqs path/to/app.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have the `requirements.txt` file, you can install the dependencies using pip\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are developing your own app, and you started in a Jupyter notebook, the installation of the dependencies is a self-fulfilling prophecy, but once we move to a virtual environment, you need to install the dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running the App\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can run your app with Uvicorn from the terminal. From the directory where `app.py` is located, start the API server with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "uvicorn app:app --reload\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down the command:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `uvicorn`: The Uvicorn server.\n",
    "- `app:app`: This follows the format <module_name>:<FastAPI_instance_name>: It tells Uvicorn to look for the FastAPI app instance named `app` inside the Python module `app.py`. Since both arguments are the same, let's change it for clarity. If you had written `greeting_app = FastAPI()` inside a file called `api_app.py`, you would run `uvicorn api_app:greeting_app --reload`\n",
    "- `--reload`: Automatically restarts the server whenever you make code changes ‚Äî useful during development.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note for later: When deploying to SAP BTP, you‚Äôll also need to add two files to your app folder: `manifest.yaml` and `Procfile`. These are only needed for deployment and not required when testing locally.\n"

    "## Running the App in a Virtual Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have re-created the behavior of the Jupyter Notebook in a Python file. However, when we deploy the app in the cloud, we will have a different environment. To make sure that we defined the dependencies correctly and the app runs as expected, we should test it in a virtual environment. This ensures you‚Äôre not relying on any globally installed Python packages from your system or IDE setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a Virtual Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a virtual environment, you can use the `venv` module that comes with Python. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where your `app.py` file is located. Then, run the following command to create a virtual environment named `venv`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -m venv venv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down the command:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `python`: The Python interpreter.\n",
    "- `-m venv`: The `venv` module, which is used to create virtual environments.\n",
    "- `venv`: The name of the virtual environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Activating the Virtual Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the virtual environment is created, you need to activate it. The activation command depends on your operating system:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Windows: `venv\\Scripts\\activate`\n",
    "- macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, you should see the name of the virtual environment (`venv`) as a prefix in your terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have activated the virtual environment, you can install the dependencies using pip. From the directory where `app.py` is located, run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the virtual environment has all the dependencies from `requirements.txt` installed, simulating the environment in which the app will be deployed on BTP.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running the App\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can run your app with Uvicorn from the terminal. From the directory where `app.py` is located, start the API server with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "uvicorn app:app --reload\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deactivating the Virtual Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are done testing, you can deactivate the virtual environment by running:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "deactivate\n",
    "```\n"

    "## Preparing for Deployment to SAP BTP\n",
    "\n",
    "Before deploying our API to SAP BTP using Cloud Foundry, we need to complete a few preparation steps. First, we need to install the Cloud Foundry CLI (unless you want to dep,oy via the BTP UI which is also possible). Additionally, we need to create two configuration files: `manifest.yaml` and `Procfile`. These will define how the application is deployed and run on BTP.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing the Cloud Foundry CLI\n",
    "\n",
    "To interact with Cloud Foundry, the preferred way is to use the `cf` command-line interface. If you have not installed it yet, you can download and install it from the [official Cloud Foundry CLI page](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "On macOS, you can conveniently install the current version 8 using `brew`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "brew install cloudfoundry/tap/cf-cli@8\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once installed, you should be able to run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cf --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You should see the version number of the CLI which confirms the CLI is available and ready to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating the `manifest.yaml`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `manifest.yaml` file defines how Cloud Foundry should deploy your app. It includes metadata such as the app name, memory allocation, number of instances, and route configuration. For a complete reference, please check out the [Cloud Foundry Manifest Reference](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/manifest-attributes.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a new file named `manifest.yaml` in the same folder as your `app.py` and add the following content:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "---\n",
    "applications:\n",
    "  - name: greeting-api\n",
    "    memory: 256M\n",
    "    instances: 1\n",
    "    buildpacks:\n",
    "      - python_buildpack\n",
    "    path: .\n",
    "    routes:\n",
    "      - route: greeting-api-test.cfapps.eu10-004.hana.ondemand.com\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down the content of the `manifest.yaml`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `name`: The name of the app as it will appear in your BTP subaccount.\n",
    "- `memory`: The memory allocated per app instance. 256M is typically sufficient for small FastAPI services.\n",
    "- `instances`: Number of app instances to start (1 for now).\n",
    "- `buildpacks`: Sets the Python buildpack (if not set explicitly, BTP will try to detect it automatically).\n",
    "- `path`: The path to the application directory. \n",
    "- `routes`: The custom URL (host + domain) you want your app to use.\n",
    "  You can find the correct domain (e.g. `cfapps.eu10-004.hana.ondemand.com`) in your BTP subaccount under ‚ÄúCloud Foundry ‚Üí Overview ‚Üí API Endpoint.‚Äù\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating the `Procfile`\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of a `Procfile` is to define how your app should be started. While you can specify the start command manually during `cf push` (this is the command which finally deploy the API on BPT), it‚Äôs good practice to include a `Procfile` for clarity, consistency, and maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a plain text file named `Procfile` (no extension) in your app‚Äôs root directory with the following content:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "web: uvicorn app:app --host=0.0.0.0 --port=${PORT:-8080}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let‚Äôs break it down:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `web:` tells the platform that this process handles incoming HTTP requests.\n",
    "- `uvicorn app:app` loads your FastAPI app instance named `app` from the `app.py` file.\n",
    "- `--host=0.0.0.0` makes Uvicorn listen on all network interfaces (required for deployment).\n",
    "- `--port=${PORT:-8080}` uses the port environment variable (`$PORT`) provided by Cloud Foundry or falls back to port `8080` when running locally.\n"

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking the API from a Jupyter Notebook (my preferred environment for rapid prototyping) to a working cloud deployment took a few steps. First, we refactored the code into a standalone Python file (`app.py`). Then we created a `requirements.txt` file and tested everything locally in a clean virtual environment. After creating `manifest.yaml` and `Procfile` files, we deployed the API to the cloud using the SAP BTP CLI or the SAP BTP Cockpit.\n",
    "\n",
    "After building the greeting API in [my previous blog post](https://chrwittm.github.io/posts/2025-07-08-implementing-fastapi-greeting/), we‚Äôve now taken it all the way to the cloud. The goal here wasn‚Äôt to explore every FastAPI feature or every cloud deployment nuance, but to provide a reusable, step-by-step template for future projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "There‚Äôs lots more you could do, e.g. adding authentication, rate limiting, or monitoring, but we‚Äôll leave that for another time. I Hope this was helpful, and happy coding!"
