The 2022-version of the [Fast.AI course](https://course.fast.ai/) was a welcome and well-timed opportunity for me to continue my machine learning journey.

After having reworked [lesson 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4tvM4Vb3A0), here are my first trained models:

* [Bear Detector on HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/spaces/chrwittm/bear-detector)
* [Bear Detector on GitHub Pages](https://chrwittm.github.io/FastAI2022/lesson02/bear_detector/bear_detector.html)
* [Cat-vs-Dog-Classifier on HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/spaces/chrwittm/cat_or_dog)
* [Cat-vs-Dog-Classifier on GitHub Pages](https://chrwittm.github.io/FastAI2022/lesson02/cat_or_dog2/cat_or_dog.html)
