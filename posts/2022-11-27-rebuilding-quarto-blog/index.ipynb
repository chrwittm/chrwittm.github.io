    "For the last 2 months I have been a proud writer of [this blog](https://chrwittm.github.io/posts/2022-10-21-how-i-created-this-blog/), until yesterday disaster struck: Upon publishing of my [MNIST-blog post](https://chrwittm.github.io/posts/2022-11-26-mnist/) via the usual `quarto publish gh-pages`, I received the following error message ðŸ˜¨:\n",

    "## What is needed to Re-build a Quarto Blog?\n",
    "\n",
    "As I kept thinking about this, the error message clearly pointed to something on my local machine. Additionally, I previously posted on [how to avoid disaster](https://chrwittm.github.io/posts/2022-10-21-how-i-created-this-blog/#step-5-avoiding-disaster), so what would be the best way to re-build everything?\n",
    "\n",
    "But let's think through the matter: What do you actually need to re-build a Quarto blog? You only need your `posts`-directory and a few other files (the ones mentioned [here](https://chrwittm.github.io/posts/2022-10-21-how-i-created-this-blog/#step-5-avoiding-disaster)).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is important, so let me re-phrase this: On your GitHub repo, there are (should be) 2 versions of your blog:\n",
    "\n",
    "* In the `main`-branch, you store your **source**-files:\n",
    "  * The Jupyter notebooks, markdown files, some pictures used within your posts\n",
    "  * The configuration files: Some `.yml`-, `.qmd`- and `.css`-files\n",
    "* The `gh-pages` branch gets generated to contain the **rendered** versions of your posts: When you check out your `_site` directory, it contains a file structure similar to the `posts`-directory in your `main`-branch, but the `_site` directory deals in `html`-, `xml`-, and `json`-files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, to re-build your site, as far as I understand it, you only need the content of your main branch, and the content of the `gh-pages` gets generated once you run `quarto publish gh-pages`."

    "With the above in mind, here is what I did:\n",
    "\n",
    "* I moved my local copy of the blog's repo's main branch to my temp folder (the milder version of deleting it)\n",
    "* I re-cloned the repo (the main branch): `git clone git@github.com:chrwittm/chrwittm.github.io.git`\n",
    "* I re-published the blog: `quarto publish gh-pages`\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all: With these kind of seeming disasters: Sit back and relax: Is this a big deal? Well my blog was down, who cared? Probably I cared the most about it - my ego ðŸ˜‰. \n",
    "\n",
    "Don't panic: Think through a problem: What could be the root cause, from what angle can you approach the problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "I think, the solution is actually really nice. The setup with the 2 branches has some nice redundancy built-in, and without having tried it before, the disaster recovery performed very well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution also reminded me of the [fast-setup](https://github.com/fastai/fastsetup) approach, which Jeremy discussed in the [Live-Coding session 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56sIyFjihEc&t=2452s): You should spend time using your tools, not configuring them. Quarto, at least to me, nicely proved that point that even if something goes wrong, you can quickly recover. \n",
