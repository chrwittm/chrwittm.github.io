    "How can compute intensive large language models (LLMs) run on consumer-grade laptops? C bindings are part of this magic, they create wrappers around the C code to make is accessible in higher-level languages like Python. While it might sound complicated, the concept is surprisingly accessible with the right approach. Let's explore a simple example to how to utilize the `ctypes` library to implement a C bindings in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "In my [previous blog post](https://chrwittm.github.io/posts/2024-02-15-running-llama2-on-mac/), I demonstrated how you can use [`llama-cpp-python`](https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python) to run a llama2-model using [`llama.cpp`](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp). To understand how the interface between these 2 project works, I created a simple C library to unveil some of the underlying \"magic\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python `ctypes`-library is the bridge between the to worlds, and in this notebook, we first create and compile a simple function written in C that accepts an `int32_t` value and returns its square. Subsequently, we use this function from python to learn how to implement the C binding via the `ctypes`-library.\n",
    "\n",
    "While I wrote this notebook on macOS, the principles and techniques are universally applicable, with slight adjustments for Linux or Windows environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "A final note before we get started: You can find the [notebook version of this blog post](https://github.com/chrwittm/lm-hackers/blob/main/20-local-llama-on-mac/25-c-binding-example.ipynb) on my GitHub."

Although aligning the types between Python and C requires some effort, the payoff is significantly enhanced performance for compute-intensive tasks like neural net inference. While introducing additional complexity, the C binding [`llama-cpp-python`](https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python) makes it possible to run a llama2-model via [`llama.cpp`](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) directly from Python, even on a consumer laptop."
