    "## Running Llama2 via Hugging Face\n",
    "\n",
    "Trying to stick as closely as possible to the original [hacker's guide](https://github.com/fastai/lm-hackers/blob/main/lm-hackers.ipynb), I wanted to run LLama2 locally on my Mac using the Hugging Face API, just to see if it worked. Without Nvidia support, I needed to adapt the code to make it compatible with [Apple's Metal Framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metalperformanceshaders). For all all the details, what needed to be done to run llama2 via the Hugging Face API, please [check out this notebook](https://github.com/chrwittm/lm-hackers/blob/main/20-local-llama-on-mac/10-running-llama2-on-mac1-hf.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "The final result was academically interesting, but performance left much to be desired ðŸ˜‰: What Jeremy's machine did in 2 seconds took my MacBook more than 3 minutes. There are probably a couple of reasons which produced this dramatic difference in performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Nvidia memory throughput is a lot better then Apple's unified RAM\n",
    "- The model I used was originally optimized and quantized for Nvidia GPUs. To run this model on my MacBook, I had to disable the 8-bit quantization (`load_in_8bit=False`) among other changes. While this adaptation was necessary for compatibility with Apple Silicon, it discarded all the optimizations.\n",
    "- PyTorch's optimization for CUDA is probably still way better than its MPS optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a key learning: Running large language models (LLMs) locally requires more than brute force. Instead, hardware and software need to be aligned. Apple Silicon machines are extremely capable, but they need a different kind of optimization then Nvidia hardware. Consider the following analogy: Imagine you need to travel from Hamburg to Munich, and you have 2 hardware setups available, a car (let's say this represents Nvidia hardware) or a plane (let's say this represents Apple Silicon). Both these hardware setups require different optimizations to get from A to B.\n",
    "\n",
    "Driving from Hamburg to Munich by car (representing Nvidia hardware), you optimize your path along the roads. If you used the plane instead (representing Apple Silicon), the same optimization would not work well. Attempting to navigate the plane on the roads, as you would a car, is highly impractical. Therefore, you would use a different way to optimize the path: You take public transport or a taxi to the airport, you fly from Hamburg to Munich, and again, you take public transport or a taxi to reach your final destination. On both hardware setups you have reached your Munich, but the underlying setup and optimizations differed significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, let's hop on the plane, and let's explore a different way to run llama2 to on a Mac: Let's turn our attention to llama.cpp."

    "## What is `llama.cpp`?\n",
    "\n",
    "[`Llama.cpp`](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) is an optimized library to run a large language model (LLM) like Llama2 on a Mac, but it also supports other platforms. How is this possible? For the details, please let me refer to this [tweet by Andrej Karpathy](https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1691844860599492721) and for even more details to this [blog post by Finbarr Timbers](https://finbarr.ca/how-is-llama-cpp-possible/). Here are my takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [`Llama.cpp`](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) runs inference of LLMs in pure C/C++, therefore, it is significantly faster than implementations in higher languages like python.\n",
    "- Additionally, [the mission](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp?tab=readme-ov-file#description) of the project  _\"is to run the LLaMA model using 4-bit integer quantization on a MacBook\"_. This means that numbers used to represent model weights and activations downsized from 32- or 16- bit floating points (the format of the base models) with 4-bit integers. This reduces memory usage and improves the performance and efficiency of the model during inference. The somewhat surprising thing is that model performance does not degrade by this downsizing.\n",
    "\n",
    "When I mentioned before that I had to turn off quantization on Hugging Face, here we turn it on a again, just differently."

    "The project [`llama-cpp-python`](https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python) serves as a binding for [`llama.cpp`](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp), providing access to the C++ API to Llama2 from Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this context, a \"[binding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_binding)\" is a bridge that facilitates interaction between two programming languages, i.e. a layer of code that allows two programming languages to interact with each other. [`Llama.cpp`](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) is written in C/C++, and the [`llama-cpp-python`](https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python) binding allows this C/C++ library to be utilized within a Python environment. Essentially, the Python code wraps around the C/C++ code so that it can be called from a Python environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "While it might sound complicated, the concept is surprisingly accessible when you reduce the context to a simple example. To keep the focus in this blog post, I separated the exploration of C bindings into [this blog post]() (LINK)."
