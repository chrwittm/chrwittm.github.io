    "## Creating a Local Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you're done developing your FastAPI app in a Jupyter Notebook, you can prepare it for local deployment by following these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating `app.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "To create the `app.py` file, follow these steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- Copy all the code from the final cell in the Jupyter Notebook and paste it into a new Python file named `app.py`.\n",
    "- Remove notebook-specific dependencies. Anything related to `nest_asyncio` is no longer needed, it is only necessary in Jupyter notebooks. Additionally, remove the `uvicorn.run(...)` call, as the server will be launched outside `app.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating `requirements.txt`\n",
    "\n",
    "For out simple project, you could easily create the `requirements.txt` file manually, but I am too lazy for that, so I am using the `pipreqs` package to generate it for me\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't have the `pipreqs` package installed, you can simply install it using pip:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install pipreqs\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can generate the `requirements.txt`. Either `cd` into the directory where your `app.py` file is located and run\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pipreqs .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can specify the path to the `app.py` file\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pipreqs path/to/app.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have the `requirements.txt` file, you can install the dependencies using pip\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are developing your own app, and you started in a Jupyter notebook, the installation of the dependencies is a self-fulfilling prophecy, but once we move to a virtual environment, you need to install the dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running the App\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can run your app with Uvicorn from the terminal. From the directory where `app.py` is located, start the API server with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "uvicorn app:app --reload\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down the command:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `uvicorn`: The Uvicorn server.\n",
    "- `app:app`: This follows the format <module_name>:<FastAPI_instance_name>: It tells Uvicorn to look for the FastAPI app instance named `app` inside the Python module `app.py`. Since both arguments are the same, let's change it for clarity. If you had written `greeting_app = FastAPI()` inside a file called `api_app.py`, you would run `uvicorn api_app:greeting_app --reload`\n",
    "- `--reload`: Automatically restarts the server whenever you make code changes ‚Äî useful during development.\n",

    "## Running the App in a Virtual Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have re-created the behavior of the Jupyter Notebook in a Python file. However, when we deploy the app in the cloud, we will have a different environment. To make sure that we defined the dependencies correctly and the app runs as expected, we should test it in a virtual environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a Virtual Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a virtual environment, you can use the `venv` module that comes with Python. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where your `app.py` file is located. Then, run the following command to create a virtual environment named `venv`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -m venv venv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down the command:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `python`: The Python interpreter.\n",
    "- `-m venv`: The `venv` module, which is used to create virtual environments.\n",
    "- `venv`: The name of the virtual environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Activating the Virtual Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the virtual environment is created, you need to activate it. The activation command depends on your operating system:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Windows: `venv\\Scripts\\activate`\n",
    "- macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, you should see the name of the virtual environment (`venv`) as a prefix in your terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have activated the virtual environment, you can install the dependencies using pip. From the directory where `app.py` is located, run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the virtual environment has all the dependencies from `requirements.txt` installed, simulating the environment in which the app will be deployed in the cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running the App\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can run your app with Uvicorn from the terminal. From the directory where `app.py` is located, start the API server with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "uvicorn app:app --reload\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deactivating the Virtual Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are done testing, you can deactivate the virtual environment by running:\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "deactivate\n",

    "\n",
    "After we have successfully tested our API locally, it is time deploy it in the cloud. I will use [Render](https://render.com/) to deploy my API, because they have a free tier that allows me to deploy the API for free.\n",
    "\n",
    "To clearly separate the local development from the cloud deployment, I created a new folder called [`app-render`](https://github.com/chrwittm/fastapi-greeting-api/tree/main/app-render) and copied the `app.py` and the `requirements.txt` file into it.\n",
    "\n",
    "After uploading everything to my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/chrwittm/fastapi-greeting-api/tree/main), I created a new service in Render and linked it to my GitHub repository. During service creation, set the following parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Service Type: `Web Service`\n",
    "- Language: `Python 3`\n",
    "- Branch: `main`\n",
    "- Root Directory: `app-render`\n",
    "- Build Command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`\n",
    "- Start Command: `uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`\n",
    "- Instance Type: `Free`\n",
    "\n",
    "After deployment, this is the URL of the API: https://fastapi-greeting-api.onrender.com\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking the API from a Jupyter Notebook (my preferred environment for rapid prototyping) to a working cloud deployment took a few steps. First, we refactored the code into a standalone Python file (`app.py`). Then we created a `requirements.txt` file and tested everything locally in a clean virtual environment. Finally, we deployed the API to the cloud using Render. While the deployment step will vary across cloud providers, the general process is similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "After building the greeting API in [my previous blog post](fast-api-greeting-server.ipynb), we‚Äôve now taken it all the way to the cloud. The goal here wasn‚Äôt to explore every FastAPI feature or every cloud deployment nuance, but to provide a reusable, step-by-step template for future projects and hackathons.\n",
    "\n",
    "There‚Äôs lots more you could do, e.g. adding authentication, rate limiting, or monitoring, but we‚Äôll leave that for another time. I Hope this was helpful, and happy coding!"
