Along the way, you'll get familiar with the basic workflow in SAP Build, explore the UI, avoid at least one common pitfall, and have your agent up and running in just a few minutes. By building the simplest possible agent, you'll gain the confidence that building agents is easy, and creating more sophisticated ones will feel like a natural next step. Let's get started."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations, you just implemented your first Joule agent! As intended, the overall result is \"just\" a Hello World agent, but this is an important first step in your journey to becoming a Joule agent builder. You familiarized yourself with the UI and performed the full workflow from start to finish, including creating a project, creating an agent, testing, and deploying it. Along the way, we also used Joule itself to fill in the agent's configuration details.\n",
    "\n",
    "From here, there are many more topics worth exploring, like Joule skills, MCP integration, or agent-to-agent communication. However, for me, it's always important to build a Hello World example first without getting lost in the details. With more complex starter scenarios, it's easy to get stuck on technical details and lose sight of the big picture. Now that you've completed your \"Hello World\", you can iteratively add more features and build more sophisticated agents. What's the first use case you're going to tackle?"
