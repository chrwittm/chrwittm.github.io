    "The [Harmonized API](https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-ai-core/sap-ai-core-service-guide/harmonized-api) of the Orchestration Service is probably one of SAP's best kept secrets. It allows you to talk to [all the language models on AI core](https://me.sap.com/notes/3437766) in a harmonized format across model families. This means that you can simply swap out the model name from `gpt-4o` to `anthropic--claude-4.5-sonnet` without touching anything else of your code. This enables you to simply compare model performance or even build redundancies into your use cases.\n",

    "By the end of this tutorial (which is also available as a [Jupyter notebook on GitHub](https://github.com/chrwittm/sap-orchestration/blob/main/hello-word/hello-world.ipynb)), you'll have a working setup for talking to SAP's Harmonized API of the Orchestration Service using the Generative AI Hub SDK on AI Core. Honestly, the hardest part is just stating what we're using 😉, the actual content is rather simple 🤓. Let's cut through the jargon and build something cool.\n",

    "\n",
    "The key advantage over the model-specific chat completion API is that you can swap models from different vendors(!) by simply changing a string, no code changes required. Whether it's `gpt-4o`, `anthropic--claude-3.5-sonnet`, or `gemini-2.5-flash`, the same code just works. This opens up easy benchmarking across model families, A/B testing, and even building redundancy into your applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also discovered another benefit: You don't need to manage deployments yourself. Instead, SAP handles all model deployments centrally. This makes life easy for you as a developer: No need to coordinate with your admin or wait for provisioning. You can experiment with new models the moment they're available. 🤓\n",
