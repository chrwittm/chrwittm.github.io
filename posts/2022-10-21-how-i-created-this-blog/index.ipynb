There is a [good tutorial](https://nbdev.fast.ai/tutorials/blogging.html), but honestly I found it a bit intimidating because it is not a simple step-by-step guide, also the [Creating a Blog](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html) page did no quite fit this category (for me).

Therefore, learning, running my own experiments and blogging happen in the same environment and with a lot of reuse. Knowing that my more things can be done, the only goal of this blog post is to get you up and running with a basic setup and explain the possibility to blog via jupyter notebooks."
