In this blog, I am documenting my learning journey in machine learning:

"The Machine Learning Journey" ;)

I am mainly writing for myself, trying to explain/clarify concepts to myself while writing,

therefore implementing the concept of "The Best Way to Learn Is to Teach".

If you stumbled across this blog and you even find it useful, that would make me happy :)
