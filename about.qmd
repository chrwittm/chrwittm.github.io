Welcome to my blog, where I document my "Machine Learning Journey".

The main purpose of this blog is to explain and clarify concepts to myself through writing,
which sometimes is surprisingly difficult.

I firmly believe in the idea that "The best way to learn is to teach."
Therefore, I am using the Feynman Technique on myself:
Breaking down complex ideas into simple terms as if teaching someone else.

If you happen to stumble across this blog and find it useful, that would truly make me happy. ðŸ˜Š
